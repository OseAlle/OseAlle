Hello, my name is Ose - short for something longer. 

I briefly learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, SQL, Agile Working. Web security.  

I went on to do a data apprenticeship and have a level 4 in Data Analysis. 

I especially enjoy using Python and MS Excel for my data solutions. I am adept in Tableau for storytelling.
